/**
 * Keeps a headline on the lines it was written with.
 *
 * Every headline in `src/scenes/locales` is authored as two lines split with a
 * `\n`, and the scenes are laid out around that: the block ends where the phone
 * begins. A translation that is a few characters longer soft-wraps into a third
 * line and pushes the supporting line into the device.
 *
 * So rather than trusting the copy to be short in twenty-six languages, the
 * element is measured with wrapping switched off, and the type is scaled by
 * whatever ratio makes the widest authored line fit. One pass, no loop: the
 * ratio of the overflow is the ratio to shrink by.
 *
 * Transforms do not affect `scrollWidth` or `clientWidth`, so this measures the
 * real export-size layout even while the scene is previewed scaled down.
